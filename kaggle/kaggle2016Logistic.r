# We will just create a simple logistic regression model, to predict Party using all other variables in the dataset, except for the user ID:

# And then make predictions on the test set:

PredTest = predict(SimpleMod, newdata=test, type="response")

# However, you can submit the file on Kaggle to see how well the model performs. You can make up to 5 submissions per day, so don't hesitate to just upload a solution to see how you did.

# Let's prepare a submission file for Kaggle (for more about this, see the "Evaluation" page on the competition site):

MySubmission = data.frame(USER_ID = test$USER_ID, Predictions = PredTestLabels)

write.csv(MySubmission, "./kaggle/SubmissionSimpleLog.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# You should upload the submission "SubmissionSimpleLog.csv" on the Kaggle website to use this as a submission to the competition

# This model was just designed to help you get started - to do well in the competition, you will need to build better models!
